# wikipedyaTest
This is a simple login test application for Wikipedia, designed to check the functionality of the login feature. The application uses Selenium WebDriver, an open-source automation tool, to automate the login process.

Requirements:

Java 8 or higher
Selenium WebDriver 
Chrome WebDriver
Instructions:

Install java 8.00 or higher on your machine.
Install Selenium WebDriver for  using the command "pip install selenium" in your terminal or command prompt.
Download the Chrome WebDriver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.
Unzip the downloaded file and place the executable in a directory of your choice.
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
The test will open the Wikipedia login page in Chrome and attempt to log in using the provided username and password. The test will then check whether the login was successful by verifying the presence of the user's username in the Wikipedia header.

If the login was successful, the test will print "Login successful" to the console. If the login failed, the test will print "Login failed" to the console.

Note: This is a simple test application and is not intended to be used for any other purpose than to check the functionality of the Wikipedia login feature. It is recommended to use a separate account for testing purposes rather than your personal account.
